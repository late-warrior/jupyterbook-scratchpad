# Installation

If you are running anaconda - 

```bash
$> conda create -n jb jupyter-book jupyterlab
$> conda activate jb
```

# Watch Environment

* Run `npm i` after cloning this repo
* Run `npm run watch-build` in one terminal
* Run `npm run watch-serve` in another
* Enjoy *almost fast* hot reloading experience

See gif below - 

* You can then begin to make changes to your notebooks from the lab or notebook interface.  This will ensure that after every change, `jb build .` is called, and you can get the latest code by
simply refreshing the browser

# Contributions

This is a very rough dev setup, PRs welcome to add more bells and whistles - for eg. narrow down the directories being watched - may result in a speed bump
