# Installation

If you are running anaconda - 

```bash
$> conda create -n jb jupyter-book jupyterlab
$> conda activate jb
```

- Install chokidar - 

$> npm install chokidar

* In one terminal, run `node watch.js`
* You can then begin to make changes to your notebooks from the lab or notebook interface.  This will ensure that after every change, `jb build .` is called, and you can get the latest code by
simply refreshing the browser
